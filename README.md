# waterview

### This repository stores all current code used for the Waterview Website.
#### Although the code is stored here, it was written/has to written (or rewritten) on VSC -- Visual Studio Code
#### All code used here is either HTML or CSS - this is the ONLY code code compatible with the code blocks in squarespace // unless you buy the pro version (which I do not have), in which case you can also use Java and iFeature
#### Update: now there is pro version, so Java and ifeature CAN be used.--- still have to be put in Jupyter Notebook oir VSCODE ( I SUGGEST VSCODE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
